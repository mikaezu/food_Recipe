        <h1>Classic Kare - Kare</h1>
        <h4>A Filipino classic dish.</h4>
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>Kare-kare has been with the Filipinos for hundreds of years. The kare-kare of today is ox-tail and tripe immersed in an achiote-tinted, peanut-flavored gravy, served with blanched vegetables on a separate platter,
         and shrimp paste served on the side. Its hearty reputation has led it to become the star of town fiestas, family potlucks, and Mama Sita commercial ads. Kare-kare evokes culinary elegance, tradition, and home. But what is the story behind the dish? We look at the three competing claims to its invention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The general consensus of Pampanga natives is that kare-kare originated in Pampanga, considering Kapampangan people often have a reputation for cooking to their hearts' content and coming up with deliciously rich fare.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Claude Tayag puts it: “If you give [a Kapampangan] a recipe with one tablespoon of butter, he will add more to it.” With a dish as hearty as kare-kare, it is likely to fit in perfectly with their cuisine. The old-timer Kapampangan, however, would disagree. His kare-kare is different from the kare-kare we know today.

            <h1>Cooking Steps</h1>
            <ul>
                <h2>Step 1</h2>
                <li>First, you need to tenderize the oxtail to be able to enjoy this majestic dish. Get a pot and throw in the oxtail and quartered onions in. Pour the water and just boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer
                until oxtail is tender. Once tender, strain the oxtail from the broth and set aside the meat and broth.</li>
                <h2>Step 2</h2>
                <li>Now, get a pan and combine the oil and annatto seeds together. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes or until the color of the oil turn orange. Strain out the seeds then pour the infused oil back into the pan.
                Throw in the onions and garlic and saute until lightly toasted. Add the softened oxtail next and continue to saute.</li>
                <h2>Step 3</h2>
                <li>Just a few more steps and this dish is done. Add the peanut butter, 1-1/2 cups of broth (where oxtail was softened) and Knorr Beef Cubes. Mix well until peanut butter is dissolved. Simmer for 15-20 minutes 
                until sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
                <h2>Step 4</h2>
                <li>Now, add the vegetables last and cook until done. That's it! Classic Kare Kare is best enjoyed with a serving of warm bagoong. We kid you not, you will definitely eat more than usual. It's sooo delicious!</li>
            </ul>
